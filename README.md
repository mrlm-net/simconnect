# mrlm-net/simconnect

GoLang wrapper over SimConnect.dll SDK allowing developers to build Flight Simulator addons. Main aim of this package is to abstract and describe common use cases for your addon application. We are trying to keep package small, simple, intuitive and performant. Feel free to contribute if there is something your are missing.

## Install

go get github.com/mrlm-net/simconnect
